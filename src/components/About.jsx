          Hi, I’m Chantel. I’m an aspiring fullstack developer who’s endlessly fascinated by how a single line of code can transform an entire interface. After more than a decade teaching science, I’m now channeling that same curiosity and love of problem-solving into building beautiful, functional products—and I’m here to keep learning, coding, and leveling up.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Outside of code, life is wonderfully chaotic. I spend most of my time chasing my toddler, and in the rare moments I get to myself, I’m usually deep in a game (yes, the epic kind—hi WoW), crocheting something squishy, or escaping into books packed with humor, magic, or the occasional snarky vampire. Sweets &gt; coffee, always.
        </p>
